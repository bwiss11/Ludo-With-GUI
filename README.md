# Ludo with GUI

## Introduction
This application is a fully interactive 4-person Ludo game with a graphical user interface. Each player will have 4 tokens.

This game was developed using Python, with Tkinter used for the GUI. It utilized the 'random' and 'PIL' libraries.

Please see the 'Rules' section of [Wikipedia's Ludo page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo) if you are not familiar with gameplay.

## Example Gameplay
Now that you are familiar with the rules, below is an example of some gameplay that will further your understanding. 

We start with a clean board, with all 4 of each player's tokens in their home area. We click the "Roll the Dice!" button at the bottom of the screen and the game begin. The player whose turn it is currently has their home space highlighted and the dice roll is shown at the top of the screen. Rolling continues until someone rolls a 6 (the number needed to move out of your home area). 

Here, the yellow player has rolled a 6 and now has an opportunity to move one token out of their home area, which can be done by clicking on the highlighted square [slide 1].
Clicking moves one of the yellow player's tokens out onto the board [slide 2]. Since a 6 was rolled, the yellow player gets to roll again. They roll a 5, and can again move their token to the highlighted cyan square [slide 3].

Players continue to roll, with the ability to move a token out of the home area by rolling a 6. Below we see an example of the blue player rolling a 6 and now having the opportunity to either advance the token already out 6 spaces, or bring another token out of the home area [slide 1]. They choose to bring another token out, and since two tokens of the same color are on the same space, they become stacked [slide 2] and will now move together [slide 3] (stacking can be done on any space, not just the home space).
